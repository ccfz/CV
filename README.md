## Caspar Fischer-Zernin

I was the COO and product owner of the SaaS company Pay with a Tweet (now Firal). For two years I saw and experienced what it means to be a developer, it is my dream to be one. 

As a product owner I was part of a team that appreciated empathy, honesty and team work as their core principles. However, when it counted I was on the side line not able to assist them. It is no longer enough for me to be part of a team that I cannot actually contribute to.

By attending the dev. bootcamp Makers Academy I complemented my experience in problem solving and agile product development with the knowledge of writing code, and more importantly coding principles. With a good understanding and some experience in writing applications, frontend, backend (with decoupled APIs) and UI, I am now looking for a development team to continue on my journey to becoming a senior developer.

## Skills

### MVP and User Stories
##### Pay with a Tweet:

**Pre-launch**: Our MVP took 3 months to build. As a product owner I had to split features into small user stories that did not exceed 8 points. I also had to break down problems in order to draw up the mockups and prototypes. Especially the prototyping required a step by step imagination as well as creativity to avoid logic mistakes and redundant clicks. 

**Post-launch**: From a waterfall approach for MVP we moved to towards a continuous deployment system. This required me to change the way I had structured problems and solutions from “big picture” packages to small verticals. 

### Team work

In a start up team work is a key to success. Working long hours under high pressure for years only works if people communicate, are respectful and can give and accept feedback. Retrospectives and actionable steps especially I think are essential to good teamwork as the focus is on solutions rather than problems. 

### Independent learning

Teaching myself skills in a short period of time is one of my greatest strengths. As my degree in politics was neither technical nor included any business subjects, I had to learn all the skills that I have used in my career by myself. Skills I learned are of a wide range and include founding and running a SaaS company, running business intel. with SQL queries, creating prototypes and UX . I believe independent learning requires the following attributes: dedication, strive, the courage to jump into the deep end and to ask the right questions to the right resource -- google, stackoverflow, colleagues.

### Running a start up:

* Related to development
 * Communication is everything: Ask good questions!
 * Only build what you need and only find solutions to problems that you know actually exist. (Makers as well)
 * Code debt is real and its very expensive
 * Take ownership and responsibility
 * Business intelligence - Google Analytics/ Hotjar/ SQL
 * Agile workflow - SCRUM, Kanban, Trello, Waffle
 * Customer support -  Freshdesk
* Other areas of experience due to my role as COO
 * Social media marketing/SEO/SEA/ Rebranding
 * Data-driven Decision-making (following 'Running Lean' principles)
 * Accounting / Due Diligence  / Business Development
 * IT Admin & HR
 * Sales - Pipedrive

### Code Academy Skills:


* TDD/OOD/Refactor/Sandi Metz
 * At Makers Academy you live and breath TDD, OOD and refactoring 
  * RED GREEN are the only colors the world needs
 * Sandi Metz is your bible and extreme programming is your codex. 

* Refactor/Start over
 * For our final project, video at the bottom, we had to spike the design quite a bit at the end in order to have a functioning product. Once the presentation was completed I forked the repo and checked out a commit that preceded spiking. The code is now much leaner, stable and flexible.
