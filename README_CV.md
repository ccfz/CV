## Caspar Fischer-Zernin

I was the COO and product owner of the SaaS company Pay with a Tweet (now Firal). For two years I saw and experienced what it means to be a developer, I want to be a developer. 

As a product owner I was part of a team that appreciated empathy, honesty and team work as their core principles. However when it counted I was on the side line not able to assist them. It is no longer enough for me to be part of a team that I cannot actually contribute to.

By attending the dev. bootcamp Makers Academy I complemented my experience in problem solving and agile product development with the knowledge of writing code, and more importantly coding principles. With a good understanding in writing applications, frontend, backend (with decoupled APIs) and UI, I am now looking for a development team to continue my road as a full stack developer.

## Skills

### MVP and User Stories

Pre-launch: Our MVP took 3 months to build. As a product owner I had to split features into smaller user stories and that did not exceed 8 points. Aside from small user stories I also had to break down problems in order to draw up the mockups and prototypes. Especially the prototyping required a step by step imagination as well as creativity to avoid logic mistakes and redundant clicks. 

Post-launch: From a waterfall approach for MVP we moved to towards a continuous deployment system. This required me to change the way I had structured problems and solutions from “big picture” packages to small verticals. 

### Team work

In a start up team work is a key to success. Working long hours under high pressure for years only works if people communicate, are respectful and can give and accept feedback. Retrospectives and actionable steps especially I think are essential to good teamwork as the focus is on solutions rather than describing problems.

### Independent learning

Teaching myself skills, which I needed or were of interest to me is one of my key strengths. As my degree in politics was not at all technical nearly all skills that I have used in my career are self taught. Skills I learned independently include everything from how to run a SaaS company, to using SQL databases and creating prototypes. For me the skills needed to succeed at independent learning are dedication, strive, the courage to jump into the deep end and to ask the right questions to the right resource -- google, stackoverflow, colleague.

### General Skills

##### Makers Academy:

* TDD/OOD/Refactor/Sandi Metz
 * At Makers Academy you live and breath TDD, OOD and refactoring 
  * RED GREEN are the only colors the world needs
 * Sandi Metz is your bible and extreme programming is your codex. 

* Refactor/Start over
 * For our final project, video at the bottom, we had to spike the design quite a bit at the end in order to have a functioning product. Once the presentation was completed I forked the repo and checked out a commit, prior to spiking. The code is now much leaner, stable and flexible.
